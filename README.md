# Prework Study Guide Webpage
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

In order to streamline the studying process I created a study guide in which I am capable of recording notes and have it suggest study topics for me. It aids me in having an area to store my thoughts and collecting a list of important topics I have learned while creating the study guide. Creating it taught me many of the basics of various coding languages; such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and how to incorporate them into projects.
